## 🌀 Gossip Glomers

A series of hands-on **distributed systems challenges** that run on a **simulated, fault-prone network** — built by [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and [Jepsen’s](https://aphyr.com) Kyle Kingsbury.  
**This repository contains my solutions** to these challenges, which test and explore key distributed systems concepts using the [Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom) simulator.
